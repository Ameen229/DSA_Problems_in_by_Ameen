Algorithm / Intuition
Solution 1: Brute Force
Intuition: We have to think of a data structure that does not store duplicate elements. So can we use a Hash set? Yes! We can. As we know HashSet only stores unique elements.

Approach: 

Declare a HashSet.
Run a for loop from starting to the end.
Put every element of the array in the set.
Store size of the set in a variable K.
Now put all elements of the set in the array from the starting of the array.
Return K.
Complexity Analysis
Time complexity: O(n*log(n))+O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) 
Code

from typing import List

def removeDuplicates(arr: List[int]) -> int:
    st = set()
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        st.add(arr[i])
    k = len(st)
    j = 0
    for x in st:
        arr[j] = x
        j += 1
    return k


if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
    k = removeDuplicates(arr)
    print("The array after removing duplicate elements is ")
    for i in range(k):
        print(arr[i], end=" ")
