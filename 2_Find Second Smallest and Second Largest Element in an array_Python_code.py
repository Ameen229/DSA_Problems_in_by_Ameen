Algorithm / Intuition
Solution 1: (Brute Force) [this approach only works if there are no duplicates]
Intuition:
What do we do to find the largest or the smallest element present in an array? We ideally sort them and the first element would be the smallest of all while the last element would be the largest. Can we find the second-smallest and second-largest using a similar approach?

Approach:
Sort the array in ascending order
The element present at the second index is the second smallest element
The element present at the second index from the end is the second largest element
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(NlogN), For sorting the array

Space Complexity: O(1)
Code

def getElements(arr, n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        print(-1, -1)  # edge case when only one element is present in array
    arr.sort()
    small = arr[1]
    large = arr[n-2]
    print("Second smallest is", small)
    print("Second largest is", large)




if __name__ == '__main__':
    arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 5]
    n = len(arr)
    getElements(arr, n)
